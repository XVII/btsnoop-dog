Looking to reverse engineer the control protocol for the LX/JK Balloon Dog Lamp.
Message me if you're interested/able to help out :)

### Bluetooth Pairing Sequence

1. Press the nose of each lamp five times quickly to enable Bluetooth®.
2. Quickly press the nose of one lamp twice to connect.
3. Both lamps are now synchronized.

To disconnect a lamp, press its nose five times.
